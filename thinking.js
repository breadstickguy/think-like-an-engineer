// Principles for thinking like and engineer

/* 	The goal of this thought process, is to think like an engineer, 
*	without having to be one.
* 	Engineers are very good at being analytical and breaking problems down into 
*	smaller problems.
* 	The challenge is, analytical thinking does not come naturally to everyone.
* 	However, as programmers, we must learn how to accomplish this, even if it's hard.
* 	Here are a few simple rules to follow through ANY exercise, 
*	that will help you think more like an engineer.

// 	Step 1:
console.log('Always make a plan');
/* 	Plans
* 	Your plan should be based around the requirements of the project. 
*	Seek to fully understand the requirements before you begin building a plan. 
*	Always ask questions!
*	Plans should also allow for change, should the requirements change, 
* 	you'll need to budget for the new/changed scope.
*/

console.log('Always follow the plan');
// 	Once the plan is set, follow it. Don't deviate unless the requirements are changing. 
//	Stick to your plan!

console.log('Always Psuedo-Code everything');
/* 	Never start coding until you have a structure that you're going to follow!
*	You should be able to describe, in plain english, what your component/feature does
*	and how it works. If you cannot, then you aren't ready to start!
*/

console.log('Never break the "Single Responsibility Principle"');
// 	Your function/class/library should be responsible for one job and one job only

console.log('Keep breaking down your problem until the problem you are solving can be accomplished with one function' );
/* 	Break it down! If you can't accomplish your goal with only one function, 
*	then your problem is too big! Break it down into smaller problems and keep going 
*	until you know you can solve your problem with one function.
